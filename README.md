# oh-my-linux-apps

I use Linux for everything. The Linux distributions I have used intensively are [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) and [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/), and they are all good. Currently I am using [Deepin](https://www.deepin.org/en/), and I have to say it is beautiful and user-friendly.
